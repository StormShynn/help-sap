Original Language

<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENORIGINAL_LANGU_GUIDL_1"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Background
</span></p>
<p>
When a new repository object, such as a program, class, or database table in ABAP Dictionary, is created,
its original language must be specified. This is specified implicitly as part of the current logon language.
All translatable texts created as part of a development object in a development project (including descriptive
short texts and long texts, the text elements of a program, and the documentation of data types or interfaces)
are assigned the specified original language. The texts are created in other languages in a translation process (triggered by development) from the original language into the target languages.
</p>
<p>
Once specified, there is currently no technical support for the replacement of an original language by another language across an entire project.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENORIGINAL_LANGU_GUIDL_2"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Rule
</span></p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Defining the Original Language at Project Level</span>
</p>
<p>
Before implementation, consider carefully which original language you want to use for for your repository
objects at project level. Developers may only create their development objects in the original language defined for this project (or occasionally subproject).
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENORIGINAL_LANGU_GUIDL_3"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Details
</span></p>
<p>
Proceed as follows when defining the original language:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>If all development groups involved in a project share a native language, then define this language as the original language of all development objects (this is known as monolingual development).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>If the development groups are multilingual,</li>
</ul>
<ul class="circlem2">
<li>then the original language of all development objects is either a language understood by all developers involved (usually English, also called monolingual development)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="circlem2">
<li>or the original language of development objects in those parts of the project where the main developers share a native language is used (multilingual development).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Monolingual development groups are a best-case scenario, but are not always possible nowadays. The two
possible scenarios for multilingual development groups, either monolingual or multilingual development, meet two different and contradictory requirements:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>When you log on to a system in a language other than the original language, there is no effective
way of working with development objects (either new or being developed) until a translation of the relevant
texts has been created in the appropriate target language. Translation usually takes place in a follow-on
translation system and has to be transported back to the development system. This means that an efficient
development process is only possible if a single original language is defined at the beginning for the
entire project, particularly in international development groups (often working in more than one location).
All people involved in the development and validation process can then use the product, even if only
for test purposes. If monolingual development is implemented in multilingual development groups, therefore,
some (if not all) developers in a project need to create texts in a language other than their native language.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>There are usually no tools or processes available for linguistic and stylistic checks on UI texts
and documentation written by developers in a language other than their native language. Ideally, developers
working on user dialogs and documentation should create texts in their native language and these texts should then be translated by trained translators into their own native language, using predefined terminology.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This second point is the reason why English is not required to be the one and only original language
for all development projects, and why monolingual development groups should be free to work in their native language, with follow-on translation if required.
</p>
<p>
If a development group is multilingual, the original language of each development object must be decided
case by case. Generally, the first point wins, since international development teams require monolingual
development to be able to use their development resources most effectively for a particular project.
In some cases, for example where subprojects require large volumes of text to be created, it could be
best to define the native language of the developers as the original language. This is particularly relevant in SAP's in-house development teams, where many German-speaking developers continue to work.
</p>
<p>
In multilingual projects, it is best develop associated business functions in a single language (at least at package level). Table contents should also be created in a single language.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Note
</span></p>
<p>
The original language is defined as the logon language when a repository object is created, which is why the logon language is used intentionally for creating and editing repository objects.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Note
</span></p>
<p>
Regardless of whether a development project is monolingual or multilingual, consistent terminology must
be defined for all texts created in the project and used across the board. In multilingual development
projects, the translation of the terminology into the relevant languages should be completed before development start if possible, so that the terms can be used by the developers. The existing
<a href="javascript:call_link('abencorrectness_quality_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">standards</a> for UI texts and documents must also be followed.
