Transaction Service and Updates
</span></p>
<p>
ABAP objects and the Object Services are part of a hybrid world in which object-oriented and classic
applications as well as mixed forms containing both programming styles can exist side by side. The interaction between classic and object-oriented update techniques is discussed below.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENOS_TRANSACTION_LUW_1"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Object-Oriented Transactions in Classic Applications
</span></p>
<p>
In a classic application, statements that change the database normally are programmed in update modules.
These changes are registered when programs are executed and the change is triggered with the <span class="qtext">COMMIT WORK</span> statement.
</p>
<p>
If the services of the Object Services are accessed in a classic application, that is, if a persistent
object is used or an object-oriented transaction started, an implicit top level transaction is automatically
created and started in compatibility mode the first time the services are accessed. All explicit accesses to the Persistence and Transaction Service are embedded in this implicit top level transaction.
</p>
<p>
If <span class="qtext">COMMIT WORK</span> is executed in a classic application, the top level transaction
is also ended and the Transaction Service starts updating all the persistent objects that were changed
up to this time. The persistent objects are updated as in classic applications. Similarly, all changes
to persistent objects within the top level transaction are canceled by a classic <span class="qtext">ROLLBACK WORK</span>.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the changes that were confirmed in object-oriented subtransactions with method END are
made, whereas changes that were canceled with UNDO are not affected. It can therefore be advisable to
work with object-oriented (sub) transactions also in classic applications to have access to an easy-to-use <span class="qtext">COMMIT</span>/<span class="qtext">ROLLBACK</span> mechanism.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENOS_TRANSACTION_LUW_2"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Classic Updates in Object-Oriented Transactions
</span></p>
<p>
Object-oriented transaction mode is set for object-oriented transactions. The top level transaction is the first transaction to be started explicitly.
</p>
<p>
Within a program in object-oriented mode, classic components that use and register classic update modules
might be called. This is possible as long as none of the classic components execute the <span class="qtext">COMMIT WORK</span> statement, since this would result in a runtime error in an object-oriented transaction.
</p>
<p>
An update is triggered by the implicit <span class="qtext">COMMIT WORK</span> at the end of the object-oriented
top level transaction. If another object-oriented transaction is started in a called classic component,
it is automatically the subtransaction of the top level transaction and is also updated when it ends, before the persistent objects.
